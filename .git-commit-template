Initial commit: Project setup

- TypeScript config with strict mode
- Basic project structure
- Dependencies: Apollo Server, GraphQL, axios

---

Add Open-Meteo HTTP client

- Wrapper around geocoding and forecast APIs
- Error handling with context
- Timeout configuration

Took a while to figure out the right query params - Open-Meteo docs
are good but had to experiment with timezone formatting.

---

Implement GeocodingService

- City search with result limit
- Maps Open-Meteo response to domain City type
- Handles empty queries gracefully

---

Add WeatherService

- Fetches 7-day forecast
- Transforms raw API response to clean domain objects
- Includes current, hourly, and daily data

---

Build ActivityService - first pass

Initial scoring logic for all 4 activities. Skiing scores are too low
even in good conditions - need to adjust thresholds.

---

Fix skiing score calculation

- Increased snow depth weight
- Adjusted ideal temperature range
- Added bonus for light snowfall

Now scoring 70-80 in actual ski conditions (tested with Innsbruck coords).

---

Refine indoor sightseeing logic

Changed baseline from 0 to 50 - indoor activities should always be
viable, weather just makes them more or less appealing.

---

Add GraphQL schema

- Clean type definitions
- Documented with descriptions
- Three main queries: suggestions, forecast, ranking

---

Implement resolvers

- Thin orchestration layer
- Services do all the heavy lifting
- buildCityFromCoords helper for coordinate-only queries

---

Wire up Apollo Server

- Express + Apollo integration
- CORS enabled
- Health check endpoint at /health

Tested manually with GraphQL playground - works!

---

Add ActivityService unit tests

- Test all 4 activity types
- Edge cases: empty arrays, missing fields
- Score ordering and suitable flag logic

100% coverage on ActivityService now.

---

Final polish

- README with architecture explanation
- Non-technical documentation
- Development notes
- Code comments where logic isn't obvious

Ready for submission.
